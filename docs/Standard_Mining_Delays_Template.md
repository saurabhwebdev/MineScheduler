## Customization Tips

1. **Modify codes** to match your site's naming convention
2. **Add site-specific delays** based on your unique conditions
3. **Mark delays as Inactive** if they don't apply to your operation
4. **Create sub-categories** for more granular tracking
5. **Use consistent naming** for easy reporting

---

## Best Practices

âœ… **Keep codes short and meaningful** (e.g., EQ-001, SF-001)
âœ… **Use clear descriptions** that operators can easily understand
âœ… **Group related delays** under appropriate categories
âœ… **Review and update regularly** based on actual site conditions
âœ… **Train operators** on proper delay code usage
âœ… **Set inactive delays** that are no longer relevant

## Quick Start Recommendation

For a new site, start with these **essential delays**:

1. **EQ-001** - Equipment Breakdown
2. **EQ-003** - Scheduled Maintenance
3. **SF-001** - Safety Inspection
4. **SF-002** - Safety Meeting
5. **WT-001** - Heavy Rain
6. **OP-001** - Shift Change
7. **OP-002** - Meal Break
8. **MN-001** - Preventive Maintenance
9. **GL-001** - Unstable Ground
10. **OT-001** - No Delay (Productive Time)

Then add more delays as needed based on your operation!
