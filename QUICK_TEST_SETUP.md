## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Basic Schedule Generation
1. Go to **Schedule** page
2. Select **24 Hours**
3. Click **"Generate Schedule"**

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- Grid shows with colored cells
- SITE-A tasks appear first (Priority 1)
- SITE-D (inactive) grayed out, no tasks
- No equipment double-booking
- Tasks use their assigned colors
- Success notification appears

---

### Test 2: Verify Task Durations
Check the schedule grid:

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- DRI (240 min) = **4 cells** (4 hours)
- EXC (360 min) = **6 cells** (6 hours)  
- CRU (180 min) = **3 cells** (3 hours)
- HAU (120 min) = **2 cells** (2 hours)

Count colored cells per task to verify.

---

### Test 3: Priority Order
Look at which sites get scheduled first:

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- SITE-A (P:1) fills hours 1-X first
- SITE-B (P:2) gets next available hours
- SITE-C (P:3) after that
- SITE-D (P:4) = NO TASKS (inactive)
- SITE-E (P:5) gets remaining hours

---

### Test 4: Site Sorting
1. Click **"SITE"** column header

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- First click: Sort A‚ÜíZ (SITE-A, B, C, D, E)
- Second click: Sort Z‚ÜíA (SITE-E, D, C, B, A)
- Third click: Reset to priority order
- Arrow indicator changes (‚ñ≤ ‚ñº ‚¨ç)

---

### Test 5: Site Toggle
1. Click site name link (e.g., **SITE-B**)
2. Confirm toggle

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- SITE-B row grays out
- All tasks disappear from SITE-B
- Equipment freed up for other sites
- Schedule regenerates
- Click again to reactivate

---

### Test 6: Add Delay
1. Click any **empty white cell**
2. Delay modal opens
3. Select:
   - Category: **Operational**

   - Duration: **2 hours**
   - Comment: "Testing delay"
4. Click **"Add Delay"**

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- Badge shows "1 Delays Applied"
- Success notification
- Cell doesn't change yet

5. Click **"Generate Schedule"** again

- Shows **‚ö† warning icon**
- No task in that cell
- Tasks shift around the delay

---

### Test 7: Remove Delay
1. Click the **RED delayed cell**
2. Confirm removal

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- Badge decreases count
- Success notification

3. Regenerate schedule

**‚úÖ Expected:**

---

### Test 8: 48-Hour Schedule
1. Select **48 Hours** radio button
2. Generate schedule

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- Grid extends to 48 columns (1-48)
- Horizontal scroll enabled
- More tasks scheduled
- All same logic applies

---

### Test 9: Equipment Schedule
1. Go to **Equipment** page
2. Click **"Usage Schedule"** tab

**‚úÖ Expected:**

2. Fill form:
   - Type: Scheduled
   - Description: "Regular service"
   - Date: Today
   - Cost: 1500
   - Duration: 4 hours
   - Performed By: "Tech Team"
3. Save

**‚úÖ Expected:**
- Success notification
- Operating hours reset to 0
- Status changes to "GOOD" (green)
- Next maintenance recalculated

---

## üêõ Common Issues

### No Schedule Generated?
- Check: At least 1 active site exists
- Check: Sites have tasks assigned
- Check: Tasks exist in database
- Check: Equipment exists for task types
- Check: Constants (WIDTH, HEIGHT, DENSITY) exist

### Equipment Conflicts?
- Same equipment in 2 places = **BUG**
- Should only appear once per hour

### Wrong Durations?
- Check task duration in minutes
- 240 min = 4 hours = 4 cells

### Time Indicator Wrong?
- Refresh page
- Check system time is correct
- Indicator should align with current hour

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your scheduler works if:

‚úÖ Sites scheduled by priority  
‚úÖ Tasks span correct cell count  
‚úÖ No equipment double-booking  
‚úÖ Equipment assigned to correct tasks  
‚úÖ Delays block slots properly  
‚úÖ Site toggle works  
‚úÖ Time indicator shows current time  
‚úÖ Grid scrolls horizontally  
‚úÖ No console errors  
‚úÖ Maintenance tracking works  

---

## üìä Quick Visual Check

After generating schedule, the grid should look like:

```
P | SITE    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | ...
1 | SITE-A  |DR |DR |DR |DR |EXC|EXC|EXC|EXC| ...
2 | SITE-B  |   |   |   |   |EXC|EXC|EXC|EXC| ...
3 | SITE-C  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |DRI| ...
4 | SITE-D  | (inactive - no tasks - grayed out) |
5 | SITE-E  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | ...
```

Colors:
- üü• DRI = Red
- üü¶ EXC = Blue  
- üü© CRU = Green
- üüß HAU = Orange
- ‚¨ú Empty = White
- üü• Delay = Red with ‚ö†

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

After all tests pass:

1. **Test with real data** - Import actual mine data
2. **Train users** - Show them the system
3. **Deploy** - Move to production
4. **Monitor** - Track performance

---

## üí° Tips

- Use **F12** to open DevTools and check console
- Use **Ctrl+Shift+R** to hard refresh
- Check **Network** tab for API errors
- Export data regularly as backup
- Take screenshots of any bugs

---

**Test Duration:** ~10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Prerequisites:** Backend & Frontend running

Good luck! üéâ
